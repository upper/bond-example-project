# Bond

Package `bond` (`/bÉ‘nd/`) is a database framework on top of
[upper-db](https://upper.io) which defines a set of hard rules and agreements
on how to work to with SQL databases.

`bond` defines the following concepts:

## Session

* A session represents a database connection pool.
* ...

## Model

* A model is the equivalence between table values and Go values.
* ...

## Store

* A bond store represents the relation between a model and a table, a store
  accepts models and commits operations.
* ...

# Requisites

If you want to use bond, your database design must follow a well-defined set of
rules:

* All models require a table with a primary key (composite primary keys are
  also OK).
* ...
